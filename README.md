# Overview

This is a small Connect-4 simulation complete with turn order control, win condition checking, and game restarting after the end of a game.

I wanted to learn the basics of Pygame including how to handle events as well as integration of sound effects and music.

# Development Environment
 I used VS code for the development environment.

I used Python 3.13.3 and some Python libraries such as: Numpy for board management and Pygame for graphics and sound. The royalty free soundtrack and soundeffects were provided by the site PIXABY.
